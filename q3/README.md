# Question 3

This C++ program that performs two types of operations on this string:
1. Concat a lowercase character from the Portuguese alphabet at the end of the string.
2. Remove the last character from the string. If the string is empty, it will remain empty.

Given an integer k and two strings s and t, if you can convert s to t using exactly k operations described above on s the program prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'.

# Building
