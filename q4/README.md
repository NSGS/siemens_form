# Question 4

This is a C++ unit test for ConcatRemove(s,t,k) function.

#Code Comments

This unit code has two types of testing: practice and auto.

*Auto Testing: This function requires strings s,t, value of k and the desired result. If the desired result differs from the value returned by ConcatRemove function, the function will return false.
*Practice: This function forces the conversion using doConcatRemove. doConcatRemove function takes s,t and k and tries to do the conversion using k movements and returns the string converted. If the string differs from the desired string, practic_test function returns false.

The main functions tests the examples provided and also do 5000 random testings, using random strings and value of k generated by random_generators functions. If any tests fail, the program stops.
