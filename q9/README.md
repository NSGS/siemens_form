# Question 9

This is a C++ program that calculates the length of a string informed by the user.

# Code Comments

The code implements get_len function, which counts all characters until '\0' is found. 

The user can test the function by typing any string directly from the terminal. Typing -1 will leave the loop and exit the program.

# Building

The code can be built with CMake. To do that, run the following commands:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./q9_siemens
```

The code can also be tested on https://www.onlinegdb.com/
